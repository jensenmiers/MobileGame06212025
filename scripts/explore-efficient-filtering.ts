OPTIMIZED QUERY FOR LARGE TOURNAMENTS:

1. QUERY ACTIVE SETS:
   - Use the optimized query above
   - Only fetches sets that are waiting or in progress
   - Automatically excludes completed sets (eliminated participants)

2. EXTRACT UNIQUE PARTICIPANTS:
   - Collect all entrants from active sets
   - Remove duplicates (same participant in multiple sets)
   - Result: Only remaining participants

3. UPDATE DATABASE:
   - Clear existing participants table
   - Insert only active participants
   - Much smaller dataset (e.g., 10 participants instead of 4000)

4. UI BENEFITS:
   - Fast loading (small dataset)
   - Better user experience
   - Reduced server load

TRADITIONAL APPROACH (‚ùå):
‚Ä¢ Query all 4000+ participants
‚Ä¢ Load all into UI
‚Ä¢ Filter in frontend
‚Ä¢ Result: Slow, bloated interface

EFFICIENT APPROACH (‚úÖ):
‚Ä¢ Query only active sets (~50 sets max)
‚Ä¢ Extract ~10-32 remaining participants
‚Ä¢ Load only active participants into UI
‚Ä¢ Result: Fast, responsive interface

DATA REDUCTION EXAMPLE:
‚Ä¢ Original tournament: 4000 entrants
‚Ä¢ At Top 8 stage: ~8-16 active participants
‚Ä¢ Data reduction: 99.6% smaller dataset

1. ROUND-BASED FILTERING:

   ‚Ä¢ Example: sets(query: {round: [3, 4, 5, -8, -9, -10]})
   ‚Ä¢ Further reduces data transfer

2. CACHING STRATEGY:
   ‚Ä¢ Cache active participants for 5-10 minutes
   ‚Ä¢ Reduce API calls during peak usage
   ‚Ä¢ Implement webhook updates if available

3. PROGRESSIVE LOADING:
   ‚Ä¢ Load Top 8 participants first
   ‚Ä¢ Load additional details on demand
   ‚Ä¢ Improve perceived performance

4. REAL-TIME UPDATES:
   ‚Ä¢ Poll for changes every 30-60 seconds
   ‚Ä¢ Update database when participants eliminated
   ‚Ä¢ Keep UI in sync with tournament progress

üîÑ NEXT STEPS:
   ‚Ä¢ Modify sync-entrants API to use state-based filtering
   ‚Ä¢ Update admin portal to show only active participants

console.log(`
The standing.placement and state fields provide a powerful way to efficiently 
filter for only remaining participants in large tournaments. By querying only 
active sets (state !== 3) and extracting participants from those sets, we can:

‚Ä¢ Reduce data transfer by 99%+ for large tournaments
‚Ä¢ Improve UI performance dramatically
‚Ä¢ Provide better user experience
‚Ä¢ Scale to tournaments with thousands of participants

This approach transforms the "Update Participants" button from a performance 
nightmare into a fast, efficient operation that only loads the participants 
who are still in the tournament.
