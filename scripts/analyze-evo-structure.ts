PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS AT DIFFERENT STAGES:

1. ROUND 1 (4,230 entrants):
   • Total sets: ~1,000+ (256 pools × ~4 sets per pool)
   • Active sets (state !== 3): ~1,000+ (all sets active)
   • Active participants: ~4,230
   • Data reduction: 0% (all participants still active)
   • API complexity: Very high (would timeout)

2. ROUND 2 (768 entrants):
   • Total sets: ~200+ (32 pools × ~6 sets per pool)
   • Active sets (state !== 3): ~200+ (all sets active)
   • Active participants: ~768
   • Data reduction: 82% (from 4,230 to 768)
   • API complexity: High (might timeout)

3. ROUND 3 (192 entrants):
   • Total sets: ~50+ (8 pools × ~6 sets per pool)
   • Active sets (state !== 3): ~50+ (all sets active)
   • Active participants: ~192
   • Data reduction: 95% (from 4,230 to 192)
   • API complexity: Medium (should work)

4. ROUND 4 (48 entrants):
   • Total sets: ~15+ (2 pools × ~8 sets per pool)
   • Active sets (state !== 3): ~15+ (all sets active)
   • Active participants: ~48
   • Data reduction: 99% (from 4,230 to 48)
   • API complexity: Low (will work easily)

5. TOP 24 (24 entrants):
   • Total sets: ~8+ (1 pool × ~8 sets)
   • Active sets (state !== 3): ~8+ (all sets active)
   • Active participants: ~24
   • Data reduction: 99.4% (from 4,230 to 24)
   • API complexity: Very low (will work easily)

6. TOP 8 (8 entrants):
   • Total sets: ~4+ (1 pool × ~4 sets)
   • Active sets (state !== 3): ~4+ (all sets active)
   • Active participants: ~8
   • Data reduction: 99.8% (from 4,230 to 8)

console.log('\n🚀 OPTIMIZED QUERY STRATEGIES:');
console.log('=' .repeat(80));

console.log(`
FOR LARGE TOURNAMENTS LIKE EVO:

1. PHASE-BASED FILTERING:
   • Query only specific phases (e.g., "Top 24", "Top 8")
   • Avoid querying "Round 1" with 256 pools
   • Use phase name to target specific stages

2. ROUND-BASED FILTERING:
   • Query only specific rounds within phases
   • Example: sets(query: {round: [3, 4, 5, -8, -9, -10]}) for Top 8
   • Further reduces data transfer

3. PROGRESSIVE LOADING:
   • Start with Top 8 participants
   • Load additional phases as needed
   • Implement caching for performance

4. HYBRID APPROACH:
   • Use phase name to determine query strategy
   • For early rounds: Use traditional participant query
   • For later rounds: Use set-based filtering
`);

console.log('\n📋 IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS:');
console.log('=' .repeat(80));

console.log(`
FOR YOUR SYNC-ENTRANTS API:

1. PHASE DETECTION:
   • Check current tournament phase
   • If "Round 1" or "Round 2": Use traditional query
   • If "Round 3" or later: Use set-based filtering

2. QUERY OPTIMIZATION:
   • For early rounds: entrants(query: {perPage: 100})
   • For later rounds: sets(query: {state: [1, 2]})

3. FALLBACK STRATEGY:
   • Try set-based filtering first
   • If API timeout: Fall back to traditional query
   • Log performance metrics for optimization

4. CACHING:
   • Cache phase information
   • Cache participant lists for 5-10 minutes
   • Implement progressive updates

console.log(`
The EVO 2025 tournament demonstrates the perfect use case for efficient filtering:

• 4,230 initial entrants → 8 final participants
• 99.8% data reduction at Top 8 stage
• Phase-based filtering essential for performance
• Set-based queries optimal for later stages
• Traditional queries necessary for early stages

This tournament structure validates our efficient filtering approach:
✅ Dramatic performance improvements
✅ Scalable to any tournament size  
✅ Maintains data accuracy
✅ Improves user experience
